	Abstract = {Summary Continuous treatments (e.g. doses) arise often in practice, but many available causal effect estimators are limited by either requiring parametric models for the effect curve, or by not allowing doubly robust covariate adjustment. We develop a novel kernel smoothing approach that requires only mild smoothness assumptions on the effect curve and still allows for misspecification of either the treatment density or outcome regression. We derive asymptotic properties and give a procedure for data-driven bandwidth selection. The methods are illustrated via simulation and in a study of the effect of nurse staffing on hospital readmissions penalties.},

@article{chagas2012,
	Abstract = { The expansion of sugarcane growing in Brazil, spurred particularly by increased demand for ethanol, has triggered the need to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental impacts of this process, both on the country as a whole and on the growing regions. Even though the balance of costs and benefits is positive from an overall standpoint, this may not be so in specific producing regions, due to negative externalities. The objective of this paper is to estimate the effect of growing sugarcane on the human development index (HDI) and its sub-indices in cane producing regions. In the literature on matching effects, this is interpreted as the effect of the treatment on the treated. Location effects are controlled by spatial econometric techniques, giving rise to the spatial propensity score matching model. The authors analyze 424 minimum comparable areas (MCAs) in the treatment group, compared with 907 MCAs in the control group. The results suggest that the presence of sugarcane growing in these areas is not relevant to determine their social conditions, whether for better or worse. It is thus likely that public policies, especially those focused directly on improving education, health, and income generation/distribution, have much more noticeable effects on the municipal HDI. },

@article{holland1986,
	Abstract = {Problems involving causal inference have dogged at the heels of statistics since its earliest days. Correlation does not imply causation, and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation? This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference (Holland and Rubin 1983; Rubin 1974) to critique the discussions of other writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and proponents of causal modeling.},

@article{kelcey2011stratification,
	Abstract = { This study investigated the relationship of teachers' reading knowledge with students' reading achievement using a direct teacher knowledge assessment rather than indirect proxies (e.g., certification). To address the inequitable distribution of teachers' knowledge resulting from differences in teachers' backgrounds and the disparities in how schools attract and cultivate knowledge, the study developed multilevel propensity score methods to identify comparable teachers on the basis of both teacher and school backgrounds. Results suggest that schools are complexly associated with differences in teachers' knowledge and that comparisons which ignore the relevance of schools may be misleading. By comparing teachers with similar personal and school backgrounds, results show measured knowledge is significantly associated with students' achievement in reading comprehension but not word analysis. The findings support policies which leverage school capacities to develop the specialized knowledge needed for teaching reading. },

@article{stuart2007,
	Abstract = { Education researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike are committed to identifying interventions that teach students more effectively. Increased emphasis on evaluation and accountability has increased desire for sound evaluations of these interventions; and at the same time, school-level data have become increasingly available. This article shows researchers how to bridge these two trends through careful use of school-level data to estimate the effectiveness of particular interventions. The author provides an overview of common methods for estimating causal effects with school-level data, including randomized experiments, regression analysis, pre--post studies, and nonexperimental comparison group designs. She stresses the importance of careful design of nonexperimental studies, particularly the need to compare units that were similar before treatment assignment. She gives examples of analyses that use school-level data and concludes with advice for researchers. },

@article{vaughan_hierarchy,
	Abstract = {Many researchers assessing the efficacy of educational programs face challenges due to issues with non-randomization and the likelihood of dependence between nested subjects. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate a rigorous research methodology using a hierarchical propensity score matching method that can be utilized in contexts where randomization is not feasible and dependence between subjects is a concern. Although propensity score matching is not new in helping to create quasi-experimental models, many studies limit propensity score matching to student-level variables. To address this limitation in educational research, this study extends propensity score matching to the next level so that hierarchical modeling techniques can be used to help minimize error due to the likelihood of dependence between nested students. A large-scale educational program that targets first-semester freshmen was used to illustrate the utility and value of the methodology. This type of program is typical in higher education where student self-selection creates difficulty in assessing its true effects on student achievement; however, by using a rigorous methodology, administrators can have higher confidence when making programmatic and budgetary decisions.},

@article{zhang2016,
	Abstract = { SummaryThe current statistical literature on causal inference is mostly concerned with binary or categorical exposures, even though exposures of a quantitative nature are frequently encountered in epidemiologic research. In this article, we review the available methods for estimating the dose--response curve for a quantitative exposure, which include ordinary regression based on an outcome regression model, inverse propensity weighting and stratification based on a propensity function model, and an augmented inverse propensity weighting method that is doubly robust with respect to the two models. We note that an outcome regression model often imposes an implicit constraint on the dose--response curve, and propose a flexible modeling strategy that avoids constraining the dose--response curve. We also propose two new methods: a weighted regression method that combines ordinary regression with inverse propensity weighting and a stratified regression method that combines ordinary regression with stratification. The proposed methods are similar to the augmented inverse propensity weighting method in the sense of double robustness, but easier to implement and more generally applicable. The methods are illustrated with an obstetric example and compared in simulation studies. },
