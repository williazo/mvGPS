Description: Methods for estimating and utilizing the multivariate generalized propensity score (mvGPS) for multiple continuous exposures described in Williams, J.R, and Crespi, C.M. (2020) <arxiv:2008.13767>. The methods allow estimation of a dose-response surface relating the joint distribution of multiple continuous exposure variables to an outcome. Weights are constructed assuming a multivariate normal density for the marginal and conditional distribution of exposures given a set of confounders. Confounders can be different for different exposure variables. The weights are designed to achieve balance across all exposure dimensions and can be used to estimate dose-response surfaces.
